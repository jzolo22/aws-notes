# AWS notes

## Accessing AWS

- AWS management console
- AWS CLI (protected by access keys)
  - direct access to public APIs of AWS services
  - an alternative is `Cloudshell` --basically an in-web terminal
- AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) (protected by access keys)
  - used when calling APIs from AWS in application code
