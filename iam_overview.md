# IAM: Users & Groups

- Identity & access management
- Global service
- Users are people within the org
- Groups can contain users

  - groups can't contain other groups

- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies (to grant permissions)
- Use **least privelege principle** - give users the least amount of priveleges necessary
- Root AWS user should very rarely be used - default to using a provisioned user
